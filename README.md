# P채채 Kolmantena Jalkana

This is our second game made on a Game Project course 2018.

The assignment was to create a game that lasts for one minute.

P채채 Kolmantena Jalkana is a game that takes place on a faraway island in the ocean. 
You have one minute to collect your limbs, build your body, and transform into a statue for others to find.

The game is not optimized for web browsers, so it might be slow/stuttering and it is missing the saving feature when played on the above link.
