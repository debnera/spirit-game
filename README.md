# Pää Kolmantena Jalkana

This is our second game made on a Game Project course 2018.

The assignment was to create a game that lasts for one minute.

[**Play it here!**](https://debnera.github.io/spirit-game/Build/index.html)   

The game is not optimized for web browsers, so it might be slow/stuttering and it is missing the saving feature.

Controls: 
Move with WASD + mouse
Create a statue by holding E
